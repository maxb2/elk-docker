! TDDFT time evolution of FeCo with Ehrenfest nuclear dynamics. This is a
! two-step process: first the forces under the influence of a laser pulse are
! calculated. In the second step, the same calculation is repeated but this time
! the forces are used to find the motion of the nuclei. The back-reaction of
! this nuclear motion is applied to the electronic system.

! This approach is valid only for small amplitude nuclear motion.

! Simulation time step, ideally about 1 attosecond. It is critically important
! to make sure that the time evolution is stable, particularly for magnetism
! which can diverge even in the absence of a laser field. Any simulation should
! be run first with a laser field of amplitude zero to make sure that all
! observables remain constant over the total simulation time. Reducing the time
! step can improve stability.
